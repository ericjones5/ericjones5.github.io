        <h2>Freshman in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University studying Biblical Studies. I currently do not work but will be a counselor this summer at the WILDS.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy participating in community outreach events, and I am active in my local church: Hope Baptist Church of Anderson, SC.  I help teach Sunday nights for the youth ministry &amp; and I say the announcements and preach sometimes during services.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I also enjoy playing sports with friends as well as spending time in the Word.
